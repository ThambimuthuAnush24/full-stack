## How to Test the Application

You can test the application using tools like Postman, cURL or any API testing tool. Here's how to get started:

### 1. Start the Application

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### 2. Register a User

```
POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "testuser",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "firstName": "Test",
  "lastName": "User"
}
```

### 3. Login to Get JWT Token

```
POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "testuser",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

Save the JWT token returned in the response.

### 4. Add an Income

```
POST http://localhost:8080/api/income
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>

{
  "amount": 5000.00,
  "category": "Salary",
  "description": "Monthly salary",
  "date": "2025-09-10",
  "emoji": "üí∞"
}
```

### 5. Add an Expense

```
POST http://localhost:8080/api/expense
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>

{
  "amount": 1500.00,
  "category": "Housing",
  "description": "Monthly rent",
  "date": "2025-09-05",
  "emoji": "üè†"
}
```

### 6. View Dashboard

```
GET http://localhost:8080/api/dashboard
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

## Security Considerations

- JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
- Passwords are securely hashed using BCrypt
- All endpoints except authentication are protected
- Proper input validation to prevent injection attacks
- CORS is configured for frontend access

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Configure your MySQL database in `application.properties`
3. Run the application with `./mvnw spring-boot:run`
4. The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

## Database Schema

The application uses the following main entities:

- User - User account information
- Income - Income records with categories
- Expense - Expense records with categories

## Future Enhancements

- Budget planning and tracking
- Recurring transactions
- Reports and analytics
- Export functionality (PDF, CSV)
- Mobile app integration
